  "Recommendation": "Don’t Buy",
  "Reasoning": "The earnings report for UOKA provides a strong fundamental catalyst: 42% YoY revenue growth, a 25% EPS surprise, raised guidance and margin expansion, all of which satisfy the required quantitative strength. However, the technical and structural conditions for a breakout trade are not met. The first‑minute high ( $0.80 ) is far below the 200‑EMA (~$2.00) and other moving averages, violating the rule that price must be above the 200 EMA/SMA. The stock is also overly extended (ADR ≈10× the 50‑EMA, exceeding the 8× limit) and, despite a large pre‑market volume surge, the price is not holding near its highs. No breakout above the opening range has occurred, and the risk‑to‑reward profile cannot be validated under the strict criteria. Consequently, despite the solid earnings catalyst, the trade fails the mandatory technical filters, leading to a “Don’t Buy” recommendation."
