  "Recommendation": "Buy",
  "Entry Time": "09:30 AM",
  "Entry Price": "$0.80",
  "Stop-Loss": "$0.7499",
  "Risk %": "6.26%",
  "Reasoning": "The earnings report for UOKA provides a strong, high‑impact fundamental catalyst: 42% YoY revenue growth, 25% EPS surprise, raised guidance and margin expansion, all of which meet the quantitative strength criteria. The first‑minute candle opened at $0.75 and set a high of $0.80. In the second minute the high rose to $0.8089, breaking above the first‑minute high, triggering a long entry at $0.80. The stop is set at the lowest low observed so far ($0.7499), giving a risk of (0.80‑0.7499)/0.80 ≈ 6.26%, well under the 12% limit. Structural checks are satisfied: an 84% gap‑up that held into the open, price above the 200 EMA, strong pre‑market volume (≈7.6× average), dollar volume \u003e $10 M, and the stock is not over‑extended. All mandatory criteria are met, so the trade is approved as a Buy."
