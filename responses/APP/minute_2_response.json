  "Recommendation": "Buy",

  "Entry Price": "$54.73",
  "Stop-Loss": "$52.75",
  "Risk %": "3.61%",
  "Reasoning": "A breakout occurred in the second 1‑minute candle as its high ($55.23) exceeded the first minute high ($54.725). The entry is set at the first‑minute high ($54.725) with a stop‑loss at the day’s low so far ($52.75), yielding a risk of ~3.61%, well under the 12% limit. The trade is supported by a strong catalyst: major analyst upgrades (BofA and Deutsche Bank) with substantial price‑target hikes and a strategic e‑commerce expansion, outweighing the SEC investigation concerns. Technical fundamentals also align: a 16.7% gap‑up, pre‑market volume 6.5× average, pre‑market volume representing 25% of daily volume, price above the 200‑EMA, and the stock is not over‑extended. Liquidity is ample (DolVol \u003e $200M). All mandatory criteria are satisfied, justifying a Buy recommendation."
