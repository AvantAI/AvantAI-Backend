  "Recommendation": "Wait",
  "Reasoning": "The first‑minute high (ORH) is $54.725. No subsequent 1‑minute candle data shows a price high that exceeds this level, so the breakout condition has not been met. Although the stock exhibits a strong pre‑market gap (+16.7%) and elevated pre‑market volume (6.5× average), the required intraday breakout to trigger a trade has not occurred. Additionally, the news catalyst is mixed—regulatory scrutiny offsets analyst upgrades—so there is no clear, high‑conviction catalyst supporting an immediate long entry. Therefore, we wait for a confirmed breakout before considering a trade."
