4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend. Fourth quarter Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $56 million with Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. $396 $361 $344 $360 $377 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Apps Revenue ($ millions) $74 $55 $61 $55 $56 19% 15% 18% 15% 15% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Apps Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 6   Conclusion 2023 has been another phenomenal year of growth for AppLovin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend. Fourth quarter Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $56 million with Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. $396 $361 $344 $360 $377 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Apps Revenue ($ millions) $74 $55 $61 $55 $56 19% 15% 18% 15% 15% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Apps Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 6   Conclusion 2023 has been another phenomenal year of growth for AppLovin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

4Q23 Shareholder Letter   To Our AppLovin Shareholders: As we reflect back on 2023, we’re very proud of the progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.   Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend. Fourth quarter Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $56 million with Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. $396 $361 $344 $360 $377 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Apps Revenue ($ millions) $74 $55 $61 $55 $56 19% 15% 18% 15% 15% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Apps Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 6   Conclusion 2023 has been another phenomenal year of growth for AppLovin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM & Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.
