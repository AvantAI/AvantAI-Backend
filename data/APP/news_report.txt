AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is under the spotlight after shutting down its controversial Array platform, a move that comes amid allegations the software may have triggered unwanted app downloads on Android devices. The Palo Alto-based ad-tech firm confirmed the closure, calling Array a test product that was not economically viable, and insisted that users never get downloads without explicitly requesting it. But the defense follows new scrutiny from Harvard's Ben Edelman, who published findings suggesting Array allowed silent or forced installations on phones sold by partners like T-Mobile and Samsungboth of which have since distanced themselves from the program. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with APP. Is APP fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Edelman, who disclosed a short position in the stock, said his research was backed by over 200 user complaints showing apps downloaded automatically or after failed attempts to dismiss ads. AppLovin dismissed the allegations as misleading and biased, arguing the claims were amplified by short-sellers seeking financial gain. The controversy surfaces just as the company's stock has soared more than 80% this year, propelling its valuation to roughly $200 billionfueled by investor enthusiasm for its AI-driven ad-targeting technology. Still, Bloomberg recently reported that the SEC is now investigating whether AppLovin misrepresented its data practices to investors, raising fresh questions about governance and transparency. During its February earnings call, AppLovin's CFO cited early contributions from Array as part of the company's growth narrative, though all references to the product have since been scrubbed from filings and its website. Carriers and device makers, including T-Mobile and Samsung, said they no longer work with the firm and reaffirmed that no apps are installed without consent. As the SEC probe unfolds and short-sellers circle, investors are weighing whether AppLovin's breakneck rise in valuation can hold against a mounting storm over its ad-tech ecosystem.

(Bloomberg) -- Over the past few years, few stocks in the US have been hotter than AppLovin Corp. The mobile advertising technology company’s shares have soared more than 5,500% since the end of 2022, making them the second best performer in the massive Russell 3000 Index, after Carvana Co. Its market capitalization is now more than $200 billion, up from $29 billion when it went public in April 2021. Not surprisingly, it was added to the S&P 500 Index last month. What a 1970s Commune in Arizona Got Right About Desert Urbanism Pritzker Slams Chicago Mayor’s Plan for Tax on Big Payrolls Cruise Ships Show South Korea’s Struggle to Host Global Leaders By the numbers, AppLovin seems like a typical tech high flyer. But questions have been swirling around the company for some time. Short sellers accused AppLovin of ad fraud, illicitly tracking children and having deeper-than-disclosed links to Chinese entities. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its data-collection practices to see if it violated partners’ platform rules to push advertising to consumers, leading the company to shut down a related product. And multiple state attorneys general may be investigating the company, according to a report in the New York Post. So did S&P mess up by adding AppLovin to the S&P 500? Simply put, no. The index isn’t a stamp of approval. It’s meant to be a reflection of the equities universe at a moment in time. Just ask David Blitzer, who headed S&P’s index committee from 1995 until his retirement in 2019. “Were we responsible to review every company every year? No,” he said. The S&P 500 has eligibility requirements for size, liquidity and profitability. Measurements of quality or behavior aren’t part of the selection criteria, as is the case for most broad equities indexes. It’s a question that’s relevant now, as a committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices will be looking for a replacement for Electronics Arts Inc. after its leveraged buyout closes, which is expected to happen in 2027. “There’s plenty of even large companies that have run frauds that were in an index that got caught and, you know, nobody really kind of looked at the index and said, ‘bad, bad index maker,’” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. The people who choose companies for the S&P 500 are trying to create a reasonable proxy of the stock market. So it’s logical that companies with soaring stock prices would get in. “The index should reflect what’s going on in the overall market,” Blitzer said. “If the technology sector is 38% of the market by market valuation, which probably is about what it is today, then the technology sector in the index should be close to 38%.” AppLovin is hardly the only company to face problems shortly after being added to the S&P 500. Super Micro Computer Inc. joined in March 2024 but was nearly booted in November after Ernst & Young quit as its auditor over questions about the company’s commitment to integrity and ethics. It also faced an investigation from the Department of Justice and a damaging short-seller report before being removed from the Nasdaq 100 Index. And just Thursday, the stock tumbled 8.7%, making it the second biggest decliner in the S&P 500 for the session, after the company gave a quarterly sales outlook that was significantly below analysts’ estimates. Super Micro shares rebounded Friday, rising 2.6% in early trading. AppLovin’s stock is up 5.8%. S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment on individual companies or potential index changes. A representative for Super Micro Computer didn’t respond to several requests for comment. An AppLovin spokesperson said the company doesn’t comment on the existence or non-existence of any potential regulatory matters, adding that it is not engaged in any investigations with any state attorneys general regarding its business. “As a global public company, we regularly engage with regulators as needed as part of our business operations and compliance efforts, and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course,” an AppLovin spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg News. “Material developments in any part of our business, if any, would be disclosed in our public filings and disclosures.” That the companies up for inclusion these days might seem to have shakier fundamentals and are being called out by contrarians is a reflection of today’s market. As the artificial intelligence boom barrels ahead, indexes keep setting records and retail investors chase the rally, many stocks are being pushed beyond their fundamental values. “A raging bull market can allow questionable stocks to run further and faster than they otherwise might,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Stocks bubble up to the zone where they can be considered for index addition regardless, or perhaps in spite of, business practices that might prove questionable.” A similar thing happened in the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when the internet was the buzz and companies like America Online Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. and WorldCom Inc were added to the S&P 500. After the bubble burst, many of those stocks removed as they fell below the thresholds for inclusion. Between October 2000 and January 2002, 10 companies were dropped from the S&P 500 for that reason, Bloomberg News reported in 2002. “Some of these you see coming, but most of them you don’t,” Blitzer said. “Then you run around quickly to find a replacement.” To make that quick shift, the inclusion committee kept a list of five to six companies that would be eligible for inclusion in a pinch, he added. The S&P 500 inclusion committee does remove stocks that fall out of favor, but the reason is the index’s stability. The idea is to keep turnover low and sector weights consistent. Failing to meet eligibility criteria isn’t immediate grounds for deletion. More than 150 current S&P 500 stocks are below the size required to be added. When the committee is weighing the backlash against a buzzy stock, there are signs. When a company isn’t immediately included in the index once it’s eligible, it generally means that the committee is taking time to understand the business. Many stocks have been passed over before eventually being added, including AppLovin, Coinbase Global Inc and Robinhood Markets Inc. In September 2020, Tesla Inc. was passed over and then added a few months later. Carvana and Strategy Inc. are the most recent high-profile examples of companies that qualified but were skipped, at least initially. “Companies that are clearly eligible for the S&P 500 but initially excluded usually face concerns about volatility, governance, or index balance rather than outright disqualification,” Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Equity Research, wrote in a note to clients on Sept. 8. “Time and performance often resolve those concerns. MSTR’s absence from the September rebalancing list is best understood in this context,” he wrote, using the ticker symbol for Bitcoin treasury company Strategy, which was previously known as MicroStrategy. While inclusion in the S&P 500 isn’t meant to be a stamp of approval, there is a sense among investors that it is a key milestone in a company’s trajectory. “In the short term at least, definitely there is some validation,” said Jake Seltz, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, whose Empiric LT Equity team has $15 billion in assets. “Generally it’s a vote of confidence when a stock you own gets added to the S&P 500.” When the committee announces additions to the S&P 500, the shares of those companies generally rise. However, it’s typically because funds that track the index will have to buy the shares to stay current. And that bump doesn’t last — businesses still have to perform well over time to see their stocks rise. “Index inclusion is a positive for stock price,” said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management, which had $2.9 billion in assets under management at the end of June. “But it doesn’t change fundamentals.” Trump’s Unlikely ICE Detention Giant Is an Alaska Native Company ‘I Want to Win’: Inside Gavin Newsom’s Plan for Taking On Trump Chinese Caviar and Foie Gras Shake Up Global Gourmet Dining Dead Dolphins and Diverted Cash Sink Cancún Theme Park Operator

Yahoo Finance senior reporter Allie Canal keeps track of several Wall Street analyst calls on top trending stocks, including calls around shares of streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) after it reported third quarter earnings on Tuesday, 3M (MMM), and Applovin (APP). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Ally Canal, live at the Nasdaq. Let's turn now to some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street. We're watching Netflix, 3M and App Lovin. First up, Netflix shares are down about 8% this morning after the company missed Wall Street estimates on both revenue and profit, citing a tax issue in Brazil that weighed on margins. But analysts aren't bail. The slew of firms from Bank of America to Morgan Stanley reiterated their buy and outperform ratings, pointing pointing to the company's long-term strength and ads and technology. Still Wedbush trimming its price target on shares to 1400 from the prior 1500, but the firm did maintain its outperform rating and that new target still implies a roughly 13% upside from here. Next up, 3M. Those shares are up about 1% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight. Analyst Christopher Snyder saying that growth expectations are now well calibrated across Wall Street and that the company's turnaround efforts are starting to take hold following Tuesday's earnings report. He also raised his price target on shares to 160 from 130, signaling confidence that new management is executing on its growth and margin plans. And finally, AppLovin. The stock edging higher after Deutsche Bank initiated coverage with a buy rating and a $705 price target. Analyst Ben Black calling AppLovin's Adtech best-in-class, noting its push into e-commerce advertising could unlock major growth and potentially beat Wall Street's estimates through 2027 even with modest market penetration. We'll keep it right here on Yahoo Finance, we're tracking all the market moves and those top calls throughout the session.

Investing.com -- Deutsche Bank began coverage of AppLovin with Buy and a Hold on Unity Technologies, saying AppLovin dominates mobile game advertising and has room to expand beyond gaming. The bank set a $705 price target on AppLovin, calling it the leading player in mobile game user acquisition with about 80% share on the supply side and over 55% on the demand side. Analyst Ben Black said AppLovin’s ad technology improves with scale, reinforcing its market position. Deutsche Bank said AppLovin’s AI-powered Axon model performs well across the open web and is now expanding into e-commerce advertising, a market much larger than mobile gaming. Even limited penetration of e-commerce ad spend could help AppLovin outpace Street expectations, the note said. The bank expects e-commerce traction to improve ad conversion rates and attract more advertisers, broadening AppLovin’s revenue mix. On Unity, Deutsche Bank set a $39 price target and said recent management changes and stronger infrastructure could stabilize growth. However Unity is unlikely to outperform consensus estimates through 2027 despite expected 7% annual revenue growth. The bank said Unity’s new engine, Unity 6, is gaining adoption, but its financial impact will be limited as the company takes a cautious pricing approach after last year’s backlash over runtime fees. Deutsche Bank added that while Unity’s access to runtime data could enhance its ad network, AppLovin’s lead in AI algorithms and expansion into e-commerce give it a stronger competitive edge.

The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: B. Riley upgraded Core Scientific (CORZ) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $30, up from $17. The firm sees a high likelihood that Core Scientific shareholders will vote down the pending takeover by CoreWeave (CRWV). Morgan Stanley upgraded Hyatt (H) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $168, up from $147. The firm likes the company's sale of Playa real estate and commitment to selling owned and leased hotel assets. Morgan Stanley upgraded 3M (MMM) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $160, up from $130. The firm sees a "more constructive" share setup due to lessened expectations. Stifel upgraded Badger Meter (BMI) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $215, up from $208. The firm believes the advanced metering infrastructure upgrade cycle is driving secular growth for Badger while the company's non-metering businesses will contribute to further growth. Wolfe Research upgraded Paccar (PCAR) to Peer Perform from Underperform without a price target. The firm cites increased visibility into the company's margins troughing in Q4 with new Section 232 clarity for the upgrade. KeyBanc downgraded Global Payments (GPN) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target following a transfer of coverage. The firm believes the Worldpay integration and the post-acquisition growth timelines may limit the stock's gains in the near-term. JPMorgan downgraded HP Inc. (HPQ) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $30. The firm says the company is "cycling past" a favorable volume and commodity cost cycle "into a relatively tougher backdrop." Guggenheim downgraded Nextracker (NXT) to Neutral from Buy and removed the firm's prior $74 price target. The stock price has moved above the firm's previous target, and it does not see significant revisions to the company's outlook for the intermediate term, leaving the shares "fairly valued," the firm tells investors. Barclays downgraded Gartner (IT) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $270, down from $320. The firm sees near-term estimate risk after its chief investment officer survey "turned even more negative." Jefferies downgraded Commercial Metals (CMC) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $70. The firm cites valuation and its near-term preference for flat-rolled steel producers for the downgrade. Wells Fargo initiated coverage of PayPal (PYPL) with an Equal Weight rating and $74 price target. The firm says the Payments space has suffered from rotation to AI-centric stocks, as well as multiple instances of subpar execution by various companies, but it thinks "too many stocks have been painted with the same brush." Wells also started coverage of Shift4 (FOUR) and Fiserv (FI) with Equal Weight ratings. Wells Fargo initiated coverage of Block (XYZ) with an Overweight rating and $91 price target. The Payments sector has "been a minefield for investors," but the firm sees some "particularly attractive opportunities." Wells also started coverage of Global Payments (GPN), FIS (FIS), Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), Affirm (AFRM), and Circle Internet (CRCL) with Overweight ratings. Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of AppLovin (APP) with a Buy rating and $705 price target. The firm says the company has built "best-in-class" advertising technology and is expanding into e-commerce advertising, which is multiple times the size of mobile game in-app advertising. Needham initiated coverage of First Solar (FSLR) with a Buy rating and $286 price target. The firm views First Solar as one of the "most policy-advantaged ways" to play U.S. utility-scale solar following the One Big Beautiful Bill. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Dell Technologies (DELL) with an Overweight rating and $172 price target. Dell should be one of the "primary beneficiaries" of a "particularly strong" enterprise data center refresh for 2026 as well as AI infrastructure buildouts, the firm says. Piper also started coverage of HP Enterprise (HPE) but with a Neutral rating.
