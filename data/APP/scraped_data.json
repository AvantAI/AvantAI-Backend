      "content": "AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is under the spotlight after shutting down its controversial Array platform, a move that comes amid allegations the software may have triggered unwanted app downloads on Android devices. The Palo Alto-based ad-tech firm confirmed the closure, calling Array a test product that was not economically viable, and insisted that users never get downloads without explicitly requesting it. But the defense follows new scrutiny from Harvard's Ben Edelman, who published findings suggesting Array allowed silent or forced installations on phones sold by partners like T-Mobile and Samsungboth of which have since distanced themselves from the program. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with APP. Is APP fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Edelman, who disclosed a short position in the stock, said his research was backed by over 200 user complaints showing apps downloaded automatically or after failed attempts to dismiss ads. AppLovin dismissed the allegations as misleading and biased, arguing the claims were amplified by short-sellers seeking financial gain. The controversy surfaces just as the company's stock has soared more than 80% this year, propelling its valuation to roughly $200 billionfueled by investor enthusiasm for its AI-driven ad-targeting technology. Still, Bloomberg recently reported that the SEC is now investigating whether AppLovin misrepresented its data practices to investors, raising fresh questions about governance and transparency. During its February earnings call, AppLovin's CFO cited early contributions from Array as part of the company's growth narrative, though all references to the product have since been scrubbed from filings and its website. Carriers and device makers, including T-Mobile and Samsung, said they no longer work with the firm and reaffirmed that no apps are installed without consent. As the SEC probe unfolds and short-sellers circle, investors are weighing whether AppLovin's breakneck rise in valuation can hold against a mounting storm over its ad-tech ecosystem."

      "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Over the past few years, few stocks in the US have been hotter than AppLovin Corp. The mobile advertising technology company’s shares have soared more than 5,500% since the end of 2022, making them the second best performer in the massive Russell 3000 Index, after Carvana Co. Its market capitalization is now more than $200 billion, up from $29 billion when it went public in April 2021. Not surprisingly, it was added to the S\u0026P 500 Index last month. What a 1970s Commune in Arizona Got Right About Desert Urbanism Pritzker Slams Chicago Mayor’s Plan for Tax on Big Payrolls Cruise Ships Show South Korea’s Struggle to Host Global Leaders By the numbers, AppLovin seems like a typical tech high flyer. But questions have been swirling around the company for some time. Short sellers accused AppLovin of ad fraud, illicitly tracking children and having deeper-than-disclosed links to Chinese entities. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its data-collection practices to see if it violated partners’ platform rules to push advertising to consumers, leading the company to shut down a related product. And multiple state attorneys general may be investigating the company, according to a report in the New York Post. So did S\u0026P mess up by adding AppLovin to the S\u0026P 500? Simply put, no. The index isn’t a stamp of approval. It’s meant to be a reflection of the equities universe at a moment in time. Just ask David Blitzer, who headed S\u0026P’s index committee from 1995 until his retirement in 2019. “Were we responsible to review every company every year? No,” he said. The S\u0026P 500 has eligibility requirements for size, liquidity and profitability. Measurements of quality or behavior aren’t part of the selection criteria, as is the case for most broad equities indexes. It’s a question that’s relevant now, as a committee at S\u0026P Dow Jones Indices will be looking for a replacement for Electronics Arts Inc. after its leveraged buyout closes, which is expected to happen in 2027. “There’s plenty of even large companies that have run frauds that were in an index that got caught and, you know, nobody really kind of looked at the index and said, ‘bad, bad index maker,’” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. The people who choose companies for the S\u0026P 500 are trying to create a reasonable proxy of the stock market. So it’s logical that companies with soaring stock prices would get in. “The index should reflect what’s going on in the overall market,” Blitzer said. “If the technology sector is 38% of the market by market valuation, which probably is about what it is today, then the technology sector in the index should be close to 38%.” AppLovin is hardly the only company to face problems shortly after being added to the S\u0026P 500. Super Micro Computer Inc. joined in March 2024 but was nearly booted in November after Ernst \u0026 Young quit as its auditor over questions about the company’s commitment to integrity and ethics. It also faced an investigation from the Department of Justice and a damaging short-seller report before being removed from the Nasdaq 100 Index. And just Thursday, the stock tumbled 8.7%, making it the second biggest decliner in the S\u0026P 500 for the session, after the company gave a quarterly sales outlook that was significantly below analysts’ estimates. Super Micro shares rebounded Friday, rising 2.6% in early trading. AppLovin’s stock is up 5.8%. S\u0026P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment on individual companies or potential index changes. A representative for Super Micro Computer didn’t respond to several requests for comment. An AppLovin spokesperson said the company doesn’t comment on the existence or non-existence of any potential regulatory matters, adding that it is not engaged in any investigations with any state attorneys general regarding its business. “As a global public company, we regularly engage with regulators as needed as part of our business operations and compliance efforts, and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course,” an AppLovin spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg News. “Material developments in any part of our business, if any, would be disclosed in our public filings and disclosures.” That the companies up for inclusion these days might seem to have shakier fundamentals and are being called out by contrarians is a reflection of today’s market. As the artificial intelligence boom barrels ahead, indexes keep setting records and retail investors chase the rally, many stocks are being pushed beyond their fundamental values. “A raging bull market can allow questionable stocks to run further and faster than they otherwise might,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Stocks bubble up to the zone where they can be considered for index addition regardless, or perhaps in spite of, business practices that might prove questionable.” A similar thing happened in the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when the internet was the buzz and companies like America Online Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. and WorldCom Inc were added to the S\u0026P 500. After the bubble burst, many of those stocks removed as they fell below the thresholds for inclusion. Between October 2000 and January 2002, 10 companies were dropped from the S\u0026P 500 for that reason, Bloomberg News reported in 2002. “Some of these you see coming, but most of them you don’t,” Blitzer said. “Then you run around quickly to find a replacement.” To make that quick shift, the inclusion committee kept a list of five to six companies that would be eligible for inclusion in a pinch, he added. The S\u0026P 500 inclusion committee does remove stocks that fall out of favor, but the reason is the index’s stability. The idea is to keep turnover low and sector weights consistent. Failing to meet eligibility criteria isn’t immediate grounds for deletion. More than 150 current S\u0026P 500 stocks are below the size required to be added. When the committee is weighing the backlash against a buzzy stock, there are signs. When a company isn’t immediately included in the index once it’s eligible, it generally means that the committee is taking time to understand the business. Many stocks have been passed over before eventually being added, including AppLovin, Coinbase Global Inc and Robinhood Markets Inc. In September 2020, Tesla Inc. was passed over and then added a few months later. Carvana and Strategy Inc. are the most recent high-profile examples of companies that qualified but were skipped, at least initially. “Companies that are clearly eligible for the S\u0026P 500 but initially excluded usually face concerns about volatility, governance, or index balance rather than outright disqualification,” Mark Palmer, an analyst at Benchmark Equity Research, wrote in a note to clients on Sept. 8. “Time and performance often resolve those concerns. MSTR’s absence from the September rebalancing list is best understood in this context,” he wrote, using the ticker symbol for Bitcoin treasury company Strategy, which was previously known as MicroStrategy. While inclusion in the S\u0026P 500 isn’t meant to be a stamp of approval, there is a sense among investors that it is a key milestone in a company’s trajectory. “In the short term at least, definitely there is some validation,” said Jake Seltz, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, whose Empiric LT Equity team has $15 billion in assets. “Generally it’s a vote of confidence when a stock you own gets added to the S\u0026P 500.” When the committee announces additions to the S\u0026P 500, the shares of those companies generally rise. However, it’s typically because funds that track the index will have to buy the shares to stay current. And that bump doesn’t last — businesses still have to perform well over time to see their stocks rise. “Index inclusion is a positive for stock price,” said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management, which had $2.9 billion in assets under management at the end of June. “But it doesn’t change fundamentals.” Trump’s Unlikely ICE Detention Giant Is an Alaska Native Company ‘I Want to Win’: Inside Gavin Newsom’s Plan for Taking On Trump Chinese Caviar and Foie Gras Shake Up Global Gourmet Dining Dead Dolphins and Diverted Cash Sink Cancún Theme Park Operator"

To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts. Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. I'm Ally Canal, live at the Nasdaq. Let's turn now to some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street. We're watching Netflix, 3M and App Lovin. First up, Netflix shares are down about 8% this morning after the company missed Wall Street estimates on both revenue and profit, citing a tax issue in Brazil that weighed on margins. But analysts aren't bail. The slew of firms from Bank of America to Morgan Stanley reiterated their buy and outperform ratings, pointing pointing to the company's long-term strength and ads and technology. Still Wedbush trimming its price target on shares to 1400 from the prior 1500, but the firm did maintain its outperform rating and that new target still implies a roughly 13% upside from here. Next up, 3M. Those shares are up about 1% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight. Analyst Christopher Snyder saying that growth expectations are now well calibrated across Wall Street and that the company's turnaround efforts are starting to take hold following Tuesday's earnings report. He also raised his price target on shares to 160 from 130, signaling confidence that new management is executing on its growth and margin plans. And finally, AppLovin. The stock edging higher after Deutsche Bank initiated coverage with a buy rating and a $705 price target. Analyst Ben Black calling AppLovin's Adtech best-in-class, noting its push into e-commerce advertising could unlock major growth and potentially beat Wall Street's estimates through 2027 even with modest market penetration. We'll keep it right here on Yahoo Finance, we're tracking all the market moves and those top calls throughout the session."

      "content": "Investing.com -- Deutsche Bank began coverage of AppLovin with Buy and a Hold on Unity Technologies, saying AppLovin dominates mobile game advertising and has room to expand beyond gaming. The bank set a $705 price target on AppLovin, calling it the leading player in mobile game user acquisition with about 80% share on the supply side and over 55% on the demand side. Analyst Ben Black said AppLovin’s ad technology improves with scale, reinforcing its market position. Deutsche Bank said AppLovin’s AI-powered Axon model performs well across the open web and is now expanding into e-commerce advertising, a market much larger than mobile gaming. Even limited penetration of e-commerce ad spend could help AppLovin outpace Street expectations, the note said. The bank expects e-commerce traction to improve ad conversion rates and attract more advertisers, broadening AppLovin’s revenue mix. On Unity, Deutsche Bank set a $39 price target and said recent management changes and stronger infrastructure could stabilize growth. However Unity is unlikely to outperform consensus estimates through 2027 despite expected 7% annual revenue growth. The bank said Unity’s new engine, Unity 6, is gaining adoption, but its financial impact will be limited as the company takes a cautious pricing approach after last year’s backlash over runtime fees. Deutsche Bank added that while Unity’s access to runtime data could enhance its ad network, AppLovin’s lead in AI algorithms and expansion into e-commerce give it a stronger competitive edge.

The firm cites increased visibility into the company's margins troughing in Q4 with new Section 232 clarity for the upgrade.

The firm says the company is \"cycling past\" a favorable volume and commodity cost cycle \"into a relatively tougher backdrop.\" Guggenheim downgraded Nextracker (NXT) to Neutral from Buy and removed the firm's prior $74 price target.

Barclays downgraded Gartner (IT) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $270, down from $320. The firm sees near-term estimate risk after its chief investment officer survey \"turned even more negative.\" Jefferies downgraded Commercial Metals (CMC) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $70. The firm cites valuation and its near-term preference for flat-rolled steel producers for the downgrade. Wells Fargo initiated coverage of PayPal (PYPL) with an Equal Weight rating and $74 price target.

Wells Fargo initiated coverage of Block (XYZ) with an Overweight rating and $91 price target. The Payments sector has \"been a minefield for investors,\" but the firm sees some \"particularly attractive opportunities.\" Wells also started coverage of Global Payments (GPN), FIS (FIS), Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), Affirm (AFRM), and Circle Internet (CRCL) with Overweight ratings. Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of AppLovin (APP) with a Buy rating and $705 price target.

The firm views First Solar as one of the \"most policy-advantaged ways\" to play U.S. utility-scale solar following the One Big Beautiful Bill.

In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth.

Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth.

Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth.

Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth.

Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth.

Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.   $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters:   Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7   Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8   Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9   Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

progress and performance across our business. 2022 was a challenging year for the industry but we believed that our culture of adaptability would help us overcome those challenges. In 2023 we released our advanced AXON 2.0 technology, optimized our gaming studios, and invested in new initiatives to drive future market expansion and long-term growth. In 4Q23 there were several key factors driving the growth of our customers and partners including a strong holiday season, year-over-year growth in the mobile app advertising market, our MAX bidding enhancements and the market shift to real-time bidding. The combination of these factors is helping the market improve advertising efficiency, which we believe will lead to continued compounding growth for our partners. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $953 million (+36% yr/yr), net income of $172 million at a net margin of 18%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $476 million (+83% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50%. Net cash from operating activities was $344 million, with free cash flow of $340 million. At the end of 4Q23, we had approximately 340 million shares outstanding. Total revenue for 2023 was $3.3 billion (+17% yr/yr), with net income of $357 million at a net margin of 11%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion (+41% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46%. In 2023 net cash from operating activities was $1.1 billion (+157% yr/yr) with free cash flow of $1.0 billion (+167% yr/yr). At the end of 2023 we had $502 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our team’s focus on execution and innovation in 2023 exceeded our expectations, driving double-digit revenue growth in our Software Platform business every quarter this year. Software Platform revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) in 2023, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. We remain focused on delivering long-term shareholder value through a combination of share management and free cash flow generation. During 2023, we repurchased and withheld a total of 54.3 million shares of our Class A common stock, which, net of share issuances during the year, reduced our total shares outstanding by nearly 10%. We continue to remain committed to further share management through an increase to our share repurchase program of $1.25 billion. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate further stability and growth. Our 1Q 2024 outlook is as follows: Financial Guidance Summary1 1Q24 Total Revenue $955 to $975 million Adjusted EBITDA $475 to $495 million Adjusted EBITDA Margin 50% - 51% AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 2 1 We have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP reconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter. $994 $1,451 $2,793 $2,817 $3,283$210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Revenue ($ millions) $198 $207 $674 $1,049 $1,842 $210 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) 136 121 457 808 1,275 69% 58% 68% 69% 69% 77% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA $119 $(126) $35 $(193) $357$301 $345 $727 $1,063 $1,503 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions) Cash Flow and Shares Outstanding ($ and shares in millions) $189 $210 $345 $388 $1,037$198 $223 $362 $413 $1,062 220 226 375 374 340 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2023 Financial Overview ALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 2022 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

Software Platform Update Our Software Platform segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew consecutively every quarter in 2023, driven by our team’s commitment to improving the performance of our technology. Over the past five years our annual Software Platform revenue has grown over 9x while maintaining an approximate 70% Adjusted EBITDA margin during that period. In 2023, our Software Platform revenue was $1.8 billion (+76% yr/yr) while Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion (+58% yr/yr), an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved another record quarter with Software Platform revenue of $576 million, growing 88% year-over-year and 14% from the third quarter. The growth was driven by the continued performance of AppDiscovery, as the AXON engine continues to learn and scale. During the quarter, we saw advertisers spend more as a result of improved performance from our AI-enhanced advertising engine. Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 126% year-over-year to $420 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 73%. We remain excited and committed to growing the advertising ecosystem as we work towards expanding our Software Platform reach in 2024. $306 $355 $406 $504 $576 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Revenue ($ millions) $186 $219 $273 $364 $420 61% 62% 67% 72% 73% 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA ($ millions, as % revenue) AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 5 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 Net Revenue per Installation 0 % 57 % 161 % 115 % 113 % 58 % 33 % 26 % 48 % 38 % 40 % 20 % Installations 74 % 91 % 74 % 33 % 45 % 47 % 19 % (3) % (14) % (8) % 29 % 66 % The following table provides the year-over-year change of net revenue per installation and installations for the past twelve quarters: Apps Update Our Apps segment revenue declined in 2023 to $1.4 billion (-18% yr/yr) as a result of our strategic optimization efforts that began in 2022, which reduced our studio footprint and user acquisition spend, driving improved focus and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our Apps Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million, (-11% yr/yr) representing a 16% Adjusted EBITDA margin. In the fourth quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 5% from the third quarter to $377 million as a result of increased investment in user acquisition marketing spend.

Regards, Adam Foroughi, CEO Matt Stumpf, CFO AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 7 Appendix This shareholder letter contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our expected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; our expectations regarding improvements to our technology and its reach; our expectations regarding the benefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations regarding the expansion of our customer base and the growth of advertising spending and the mobile app ecosystem; our expectations regarding share repurchases; and our expectations regarding our future strategy and expansion in Connected-TV and OEM \u0026 Carrier. Our expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties, including changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business due to our limited operating history, the macroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our operational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our inability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements contained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 8 Non-GAAP Financial Metrics To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below. We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-operating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense and transaction bonuses, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition services, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale of long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we believe these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our business, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to measures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and prospects. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage our business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our liquidity. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. AppLovin Corporation / 4Q23 Shareholder Letter 9 Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Quarterly Key Metrics Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our apps do not utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore, our MAPs figure for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 100% of our IAP revenue during the three months ending December 31, 2023, and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 Monthly Active Payers (millions) 1.8 1.9 Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $47 $46 Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.
